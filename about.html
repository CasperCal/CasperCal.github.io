    <p> I'm Casper, a 27 year old software developer at the start of his journey into the IT landscape. After having worked in hospitality for about 4 years I'm very excited to get into something new. </p>
    <p> After having worked in different types of restaurants, from burger places to fine dining, I started getting into coding about a year ago and I've been loving it ever since. </p>
    <p> My main experiences are back-end related. Using C and C++ with some Python and Rust from time to time. I look forward to learning a lot more and broadening my horizon with Switchfully and I'm even more excited to start working as Software Engineer at UZ Brussel thereafter. </p>
    <p> If you want to check out some of my projects thus far feel free to check out my <a href='https://github.com/CasperCal'>Github</a> profile and give me a follow if you want to keep up with my projects. </p>
